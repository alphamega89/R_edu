library("sna")
n = network(rgraph(10, tprob = 0.2), directed = FALSE)

# Let’s now add categorical and continuous attributes for both edges and vertices
n %v% "family" = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE)
n %v% "importance" = sample(1:3, 10, replace = TRUE)

# We now add a categorical edge attribute called "type", 
# which is set to either "x", "y" or "z", and a continuous vertex 
# attribute called "day", which is set to either 1, 2 or 3.
e = network.edgecount(n)
set.edge.attribute(n, "type", sample(letters[24:26], e, replace = TRUE))
set.edge.attribute(n, "day", sample(1:3, e, replace = TRUE))

# Let’s now draw the network edges using geom_edges
# theme_blank
ggplot(data = ggnetwork(n), 
       aes(x = x, 
           y = y, 
           xend = xend, 
           yend = yend)) +
